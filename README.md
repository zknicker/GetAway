GetAway is a game where the player, stranded on an island, must survive the dinosaurs that inhabit the surrounding area to ultimately escape on a crafted raft. The game features intelligent dinosaurs, a reasonably complex crafting system, procedurally generated island terrain, and a slew of other features.
